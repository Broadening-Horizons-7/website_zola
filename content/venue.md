## Traveling to Rome

Rome is served by two airports: Fiumicino (FCO) and Ciampino (CIA). Both airports are connected to the city center by train and bus services. We recommend Fiumicino airport as it provides a direct train service to the city center. The train station is located in the airport and the train takes you to Termini station in about 30 minutes, with departures scheduled every 15 minutes. Train tickets costs 14â‚¬ and can be purchased at the station or online. For more information, visit the [Trenitalia website](https://www.trenitalia.com/en/services/leonardo-express.html).

If you prefer to arrive by train, Rome is well-connected to the rest of Italy and Europe by high-speed trains. The main train station is Termini, which is connected to the Metro A and B lines. Tiburtina station is also a major hub for trains and buses and is connected to the Metro B line. Train services are provided by [Trenitalia](https://www.trenitalia.com/en.html) and [Italo](https://www.italotreno.it/en).
