## Session 1: Archaeology as a Global Science

This session discusses the current role of interdisciplinarity, multidisciplinarity, and transdisciplinarity in Archaeology. It welcomes papers presenting the results of studies, analyzing archaeological data while using approaches borrowed from other research domains, ranging from computational analysis to hard science, to social sciences.

## Session 2: From Household to State and Back: Interdisciplinary Approaches to the Study of Ancient Economies. 

The study of ancient economic systems is a pivotal aspect in the reconstruction of past societies. Subsistence strategies, control and management of resources, as well as trade and exchange for the procurement of luxury goods and basic raw materials, mirror the social and political organization of ancient communities, and their interactions with each other. Material culture and textual sources reveal diverse micro and macro aspects of these complex intertwined systems on both rural and urban scales. Thise session welcomes papers that address studies of ancient economic systems based on theoretical approaches, textual, archaeological, or combined evidence using traditional or modern approaches.

## Session 3: ‘Land & the City’: Interpretive Approaches to Urban and Landscape Studies. 

Landscape studies have fuelled the debates on urban and rural environments in the ancient world, focusing on settlement patterns and on territorial socio-economic strategies of cities. Exploitation of resources, communication networks, and demography could be considered to analyze the diachronic development of the ancient socio-economic landscape. SimilarlyIn the same way, a synergycombination of geological, paleo-environmental, and textual datasets may shed light on contribute to investigating the relationships between cities, rural, and pastoral communities. Encompassing theoretical and empirical approaches, this session welcomes papers, dealing with urbanism and its definition in different historical and geographical contexts, examining interactions between urban and non-urban settlements, and the exploration of following long-term landscape change patterns in different regions.


## Session 4: Crafting Identity and Clusters through Material Culture, Iconography and Texts. 

The study of visual and textual means of communication is key to understanding how people constructed identities and created connections across space and time. Comparing evidence across sets of artifacts and from iconography may reveal clues about how material culture was used for the construction of social identities, to indicate the rank or role of given individuals within a community and signal the relations among communities. This session welcomes papers on material culture and iconography as expressions of group identity, building either on traditional analysis, approaches based on texts and images or art history, or borrowing methodologies from cognitive approaches, semiotics, sociology, as well as the study of political communication strategies.

## Session 5: Public Engagement and Cultural Heritage: The Role of Communication and Dissemination in the Humanities. 

The session welcomes papers that discuss activities of awareness-raising, capacity building, monitoring and managing of archaeological risk, and innovative strategies for dissemination and communication of Cultural Heritage including open access research data for public use at academic and non-academic level. The session welcomes papers dealing with new analytical approaches through the implementation of new technologies, the use of GIS predictivity to safeguard the archaeological heritage at risk, virtual 3D reconstruction of monuments and museums, and the digitization of archives, or open access research data. Likewise, special attention will be given to talks that discuss the involvement of local communities as active actors in the reconstruction of their local past, and the results of successful collaborations between scholars and non-academics from different countries.
