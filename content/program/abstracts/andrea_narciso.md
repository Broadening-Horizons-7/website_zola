The poster presents an ongoing research about the coastal district of Ĝirsu-Lagaš province: it addresses its landscape context and the location of the main anthropic elements and urban settlements attested in the numerous written artefacts found in Ĝirsu. New epigraphic and archaeological methodologies are explored in order to propose a new season of studies on the economically and administratively important district of Gu'abba: the study of the landscape, the reconstruction of the palaeo-environment and the ancient natural and artificial river routes play a fundamental role in the research of ancient sites in the area, in the understanding of the evolution of the territory and the strategic importance of the city and its district in relation to the broader historical developments in the region.
