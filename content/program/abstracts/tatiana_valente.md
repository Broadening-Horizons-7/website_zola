It has long been observed that ritual practices integrated with and even influenced the economic system of societies Worldwide, and such was no different in Southeast Arabian Iron Age. However, the dynamics behind it have never been adequately understood. In many sites, such as Bithnah, Mudhmar, or Saruq al-Hadid, copper-base and iron items, softstone vessels, and imported wares were found in votive contexts where such items were ceremonially offered to a snake deity, in association to the control of particular resources. In other sites, such as Muweilah, Rumeilah, Bida Bint Saud, similar items were discovered in the commonly known “columned halls”, but these seem to have a rather consecrating function for the gatherings there performed, and most important for the people who were allowed into these. Nevertheless, given the similarities of both assemblages, ritualistic offerings and meeting/gathering sites/buildings have often been confused and mislabeled. The objective of this study is thus to identify the features that characterize (and differentiate) each activity – from purely ritual/religious to socio-ritualistic and economic. Using a typological and spatial distribution approach, we hope to identify which artefacts can relate to either one and/or other and how they can help understand the dynamics behind such “ritual economy”.
