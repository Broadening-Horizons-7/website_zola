The present study involves a cross-contextual analysis of local awareness regarding the archaeological site and the degree of emotional involvement and participation of local people in two different contexts. The first case is the archaeological site of Arslantepe (Turkey), investigated for more than 60 years by the Italian Archaeological Mission in Eastern Anatolia (MAIAO) of Sapienza University of Rome, and the surrounding village of Orduzu (Malatya). The second one is the site of Tell Hisban (Jordan), where the excavations have been carried out by Andrews University since 1968, and the local village of Hisban (Madaba). In both contexts, the qualitative method of in-depth semi-structured interviews with local people was applied. The primary objective is to explore, through a systematic literature review complements the data and facilitates comparison, the perspectives provided by participantsâ€™ responses on the key factors influencing local connection to heritage. This study emphasizes the crucial role of community archaeology in establishing a direct, two-way dialogue between professionals and local communities, enabling active participation in the sustainable preservation and enhancement of both tangible and intangible heritage.
