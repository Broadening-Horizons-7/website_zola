Bes, exotic deity par excellence, is marked by its strong apotropaic value and the close connection between its own functions and the most biologically fragile members of society: children, women, mothers. These characteristics determined Bes fortune across the Mediterranean cultures.
From one culture to another, the dwarf god maintained the skills described above, while adapting its iconography and valences according to the new realities with which he came into contact. This openness favoured an overlap with other local deities, even a total one, and makes it possible to recognise iconographies in the Classical West that explicitly refer to oriental contexts.
In particular, some figurations of Bes from ancient Capuan sanctuaries reveal a strong connection with Egyptian, Cypriot and Near Eastern works, implying the presence within Capuan society of persons of oriental culture.
It is currently impossible to determine whether this culture is original or acquired, as it can also fluctuate from a superficial fascination to a variously conscious adherence and appropriation. This imposes some reflections on the composition of the realities underlying the cultural identities suggested by the archaeological evidence and the near-eastern elements assimilated into Mediterranenan koin√©.
