This paper aims to outline the chronological and cultural markers that characterized the pottery production in the Erbil Plain (Kurdistan Region of Iraq) during the Late Iron Age (6th â€“ 4th BCE) and the Hellenistic period (331-141 BCE), focusing on elements of continuity from the Assyrian tradition and changes introduced by external influences, as identified in the available data. 
To achieve this, I will employ data from Late Iron Age and Hellenistic contexts excavated at two sites currently under investigation, Aliawa and Gird-I Matrab, which, despite being located only a few kilometers apart, differ in settlement history and function within the region.
