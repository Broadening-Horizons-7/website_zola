In the 1st century BC, Cilicia underwent significant changes with the decline of the Seleucid Empire and the rise of Roman influence. The Romans brought stability and reduced piracy after Cilicia became a Roman province However, Greek continued to be the primary language of the local population, while Latin was not widely adopted. The absence of Latin inscriptions before the Sullan period supports this idea, suggesting that Greek was preferred in daily life while Latin usage was largely restricted to official purposes.

This study focuses on Cilicia, exploring how political and economic shifts impacted language, religion, and daily life. It examines how communication and power dynamics within societies and institutions were shaped by these changes. The aim is to offer a new perspective on the extent to which language policies influenced power structures and consequently, societal identity.
