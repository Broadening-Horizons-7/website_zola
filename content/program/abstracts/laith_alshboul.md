This paper examines the persistent chronological challenges in Iron Age research from the Northern Jordanian Plateau, which obstruct accurate interpretations of settlement patterns and sociopolitical structures. Despite ongoing research, gaps in the current chronology prevent a comprehensive reconstruction of the regionâ€™s historical narrative. This study synthesizes data from recent excavations and surveys, emphasizing the need for refined pottery analysis to enhance dating accuracy. Without a coherent timeline, understanding cultural interactions and identity formation within Iron Age communities remains incomplete. By addressing these issues, this research advances the ongoing discussion on refining chronological methods, contributing to a deeper understanding of the social and cultural developments in the Northern Jordanian Plateau during the Iron Age.
