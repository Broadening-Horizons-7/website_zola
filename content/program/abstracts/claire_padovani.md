At the end of the 3rd millennium BCE in southern Mesopotamia, kitchen complexes equipped with large ovens were associated with temples and ziggurats. These complexes indicate the organisation of feasting as part of regular religious ceremonies within temple estates. Prior to the installation of standardized kitchen, various sites in Southwest Asia dating from the early 3rd millennium BCE or the Late Chalcolithic period, displayed isolated or grouped firing structures related to monumental complexes and mass-produced vessels. They form a heterogeneous corpus, often challenging to characterize. Their strategic location suggests they could have been used for food preparation or distribution during large gatherings. This study examines the morphology and function of these pyro-structures as well as their potential role in horizontal socialisation processes managed by political and/or religious institutions. In Late Chalcolithic societies, we observe isolated or grouped pyro-structures in the access path to monumental buildings. At the beginning of the Early Bronze Age, associations of pyro-structures were integrated in architectural annexes of restricted access buildings. We propose that these pyro-structures played a crucial role in commensal practices, which were important social activities that helped establish and reinforce cultural norms. The continuity of the association of pyro-structures with monumental buildings and mass-produced vessels suggests that these practices probably persisted from the 4th to the 3rd millennium BCE. However, these practices appeared to have shifted from political to religious contexts.
