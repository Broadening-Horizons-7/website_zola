This poster explores the significance of Neolithic statuary in the Levant, focusing on the period from approximately 8,000 to 6,500 BCE. During this transformative era, the emergence of agricultural societies led to profound shifts in cultural and artistic expression. The statuary, often depicting human forms, animals, and abstract motifs, served as a vital window into the social, religious, and economic dynamics of early Levantine communities.
Analysing key archaeological sites, including Jericho, Ain Ghazal and Gobekli Tepe this study highlights the diverse materials and techniques used in statuary production, reflecting advancements in craftsmanship. The figures often exhibit stylized features, suggesting a symbolic role in ritual practices or ancestral veneration, while their placement in domestic and communal spaces indicates a connection to identity and community cohesion.
Furthermore, this research addresses the interplay between art and emerging social hierarchies, suggesting that these sculptures were instrumental in negotiating individual and collective identities. By examining Neolithic statuary in the Levant, this poster contributes to a broader understanding of early human creativity and the cultural transformations that accompanied the rise of settled life. Ultimately, it underscores the enduring legacy of these artifacts in the history of human artistic expression.
