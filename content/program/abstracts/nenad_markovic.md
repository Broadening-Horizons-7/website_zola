The collection of inscriptions found in the Memphite Serapeum in North Saqqara, which dates to the reign of Darius I (518–486 BCE), reveals a recurring phenomenon: the consistent inclusion of genealogical references, predominantly patrilineal. The number of previous generations mentioned ranges from 4 to 21, mainly determined by the size and design of the monument. Notably, most of the inscriptions are associated with various temple officials and their respective families, occupying cultic functions in several urban centres across the Nile Delta, such as Memphis, Letopolis, Sais, and Buto. The objective of this paper is to examine the dynastic strategies that contributed to the overall rise in inscribed genealogies during the First Persian Period. Specifically, it aims to explore the office transmission and recycling of a renowned personal name within a family. Two case studies will be presented to illustrate this: the first group comprises the descendants of the high priest of Ptah, and the second group encompasses the lineage of scribes of the divine books in the temple of Ptah.
