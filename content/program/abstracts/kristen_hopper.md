Using examples from previous fieldwork in NE Iran and the South Caucasus, and current
fieldwork in southern Iraq, I will discuss the value of diachronic, multi-scalar and multidisciplinary
approaches to unpacking and interpreting the complex archaeological landscapes of southwest Asia.
In addition to traditional surveys, remote sensing, and textual analysis, landscape studies are
increasingly incorporating other methods such as geoarchaeological, palaeobotanical, and isotopic
analyses, which are leading to exciting new interpretations of how past communities interacted with
and shaped their environments. I will also discuss how this knowledge, the methodologies we
employ, and the large-scale datasets we produce have put us in an excellent position to contribute
to tackling modern challenges in the region.
