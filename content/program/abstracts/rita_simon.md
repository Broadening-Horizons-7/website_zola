For the modern era the so-called Libyan Glass Area, located approximately 800 kms from the
Nile Valley in the Great Sand Sea of the Egyptian Western Desert, was discovered and first
mentioned by the French Consul of Jeddah, Fulgence Fresnel, in 1846. Yet, the actual
scientific discovery of the area waited until 1932.
Though the formation of the Libyan Glass is still under discussion, in the past decades
exploring expeditions found scattered traces of neolithic use of the material in the form of
chipped stone tools and axes in the far-off desert around the Area. Yet curiously, the only
authenticated occurrence of the material as far as the Nile Valley is in a pectoral from the
tomb of Tutankhamon (KV 62). The motifs of the pectoral represent a complex symbolism
related to the revitalising resurrection of the pharaoh propelled by the forever
transformation of the moon and the sun from each other.
In my presentation, I will examine the some of the possibilities of how and when the natural
glass scrap that made up Tutankhamunâ€™s scarab in the pectoral could have ended up in the
Nile Valley (e.g. by way of inw or expeditionary operations). This may shed some light on the
connections between the Nile Valley and the oasis borderland during the 18 th Dynasty.
