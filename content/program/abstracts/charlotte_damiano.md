What were the first cities like ? This is a significant question, challenging to answer with our modern perspectives. Classical theories propose that the first cities marked the shift from nomadic, agrarian lifestyles to complex urban societies. However, evidence for these lifestyles in early cities is often limited : how, then, can we tell the difference between urban and ‘’non-urban’’ ? Archaeological evidence can help us draw a line between these two systems, provided we have clear definitions of both concepts. 
Through this paper we aim to revisit the definition of the city and the ‘urban’ based on evidence from the earliest urban societies, particularly in southern Mesopotamia. By examining archaeological findings, we will explore the characteristics that distinguish these early cities from non-urban settlements. These characteristics include permanent structures, specialized buildings, infrastructure, and diverse economic activities.
We will discuss how early cities, like Uruk-Warka, featured permanent dwellings, public buildings, and infrastructure such as streets and irrigation systems, reflecting a high level of societal organization. Understanding these elements will help us appreciate the transformative impact of early urbanisation on human society. Through this paper, we aim to refine our understanding of what defines the first cities and the urban experience in ancient times.
