This paper explores the public response to “The mummy of Ramses. The immortal pharaoh,” a multisensory exhibition held at the Museum of Near East, Egypt, and Mediterranean at Sapienza University of Rome. Created in collaboration with FabLab SAPeri&Co., the event allowed visitors to interact directly with a meticulously crafted replica of pharaoh Ramses II’s mummy, made from organic and sustainable materials. Unlike traditional displays, this reproduction was accessible for visitors to touch, creating an immersive experience. Designed by an interdisciplinary team of experts using 3D modeling and traditional craftsmanship, the replica engaged over 5,000 visitors. Their interactions were studied and monitored through a Google Form questionnaire, revealing that tactile engagement significantly enhanced the museum experience, transforming it from passive observation to active exploration. This approach also proved to be an effective tool in enriching the archaeological storytelling. The exhibition included plastic models of Ramses II’s tomb and reconstructions of scenes from the Battle of Kadesh. These elements, along with the chance to feel and smell a selection of substances used in mummification, generated high interest and involvement among visitors. The familiar figure of Ramses II, combined with the multisensory approach, allowed for an inclusive and participatory museum experience that went beyond the visual, making it especially engaging for children and visitors with disabilities.
