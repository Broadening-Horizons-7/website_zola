This contribution presents a Ph.D. project based at Sapienza Università di Roma, in
collaboration with the Cultural Heritage and Ethics Research Unit of the CNR CID Ethics and
ISPC. The project aims at identifying and analyzing ethical issues in “sensitive” contexts within the
MENA region, beginning with the definition of ethical “sensitivity” and exploring possible
scenarios. One of its goals is to develop an ethical toolkit for Italian archaeologists working in such
areas, testing methodologies and applied research within the framework of a number of Italian
archaeological projects and expeditions, such as the Italian Archaeological Mission in the Erbil
Plain of the University of Milan in Iraqi Kurdistan. This mission’s focus on public archaeology and
ethnoarchaeology will provide valuable insights for understanding research ethics in this
underexplored region. The paper will discuss some key ethical issues in archaeological research in
Iraq, examining the relationship between local communities and archaeological investigations in
post-conflict settings. It will also address another crucial aspect, e.g. the collection and treatment
of human remains in the Middle East and Egypt, presenting the different approaches followed
today and in the past. Keywords: Ethics, MENA Region, Archaeological Research
