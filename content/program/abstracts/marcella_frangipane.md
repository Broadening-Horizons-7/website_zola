The substantial change that has been experienced by archaeology in recent decades has involved, among other things, the importance gained in archaeological research by the contribution of other sciences and the ever more widespread awareness of the need for regular interaction with them. The research areas that in bio-physical and natural sciences have contributed to the reconstruction of past societies have rightly no longer been defined as 'subsidiary sciences' of archaeology, and they have strongly developed new methodologies and scientific goals of their own. However, the increasing specialisation in each of these fields may entail the risk of increasing independence and separateness of the different research sectors to the detriment of the constant and structural dialogue that can only bring significant results in archaeology as well as in the other related research areas.
The paper wants to emphasise the need to overcome disciplinary boundaries (which is not in contradiction to the specialisation required in each of those disciplinary fields) in order to recompose the many and different “fragments of the past” into a comprehensive historical reconstruction of the processes of development and change in societies.
