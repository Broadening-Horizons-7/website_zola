The phenomenon of archaeological collecting, which flourished in the Nineteenth and Twentieth
centuries in Europe, has also produced a series of public and private collections in Italy, which
today have largely merged into museum institutions. The paper presents the results of the census
and preliminary study of the public collections of Ancient Near Eastern artifacts in the Lombardy
region. This study is carried out in the context of the ArCOA Project (Archivi e Collezioni
dellâ€™Oriente Antico in Italia) coordinated by the State University of Milan and by the CNR Institute of
Heritage Sciences. In particular the Mesopotamian collection kept at the "Paolo Giovio" Civic
Archaeological Museum in Como, used as a pilot for the entire project, is here illustrated in detail.
