Niğde-Kınık Höyük, located on the northeastern edge of the Bor-Ereğli plain in southern Cappadocia, occupies a pivotal position along major ancient trade and communication routes connecting Central Anatolia with the Levant. This location underlines the site's historical significance, making it a focal point for regional interaction. Over the last twelve years, excavations at Kınık Höyük have revealed a rich stratigraphy, including multiple occupation phases from the first millennium BCE. A major discovery during the 2021 excavarion season was a primary context within a room in the Lower Town, dated to Middle Iron Age, filled with a large assemblage of artifacts, predominantly ceramics. Since primary contexts from the Iron Age are uncommon in Central Anatolia, this room could be a key resource for understanding the material culture and daily life of the region. The study of this assemblage offers critical insights into the political, social, and economic dynamics that shaped Central Anatolia during this period. Moreover, it enhances our understanding of the role of Niğde-Kınık Höyük as a major centre in Iron Age Anatolia, highlighting its influence in regional networks of trade and culture.
