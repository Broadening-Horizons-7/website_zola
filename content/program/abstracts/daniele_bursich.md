The study conducted, never done in Selinus (Sicily - Italy), on the road systems and negative signs found along the streets of the Urban Sanctuary, use a spread variety of methodologies: from 3D scanning to space syntax analysis, from lidar mapping to 3D GIS. The study allow to reconstruct how change the public space from the Greek to Punic/Hellenistic phase, the hierarchy of the streets, the directions of traffic, the turning arches of the carts, and much more. Among all the road systems and negative signs there are some that, if read together with others, can offer new line of thinking, outline different levels of reading of public areas and provide a new perception of the organization of space.
