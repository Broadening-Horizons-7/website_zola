Throughout the history of the Ancient Near East, the lowland civilizations of Mesopotamia and
the Iranian Highlands have maintained dynamic interactions that influenced both regions. These
exchanges contributed to a blending of cultural traits, especially evident on the Iranian Central
Plateau, which served as a vital contact zone. This duality of cultural influences is particularly
apparent in the material culture of the 4 th millennium BCE, where the urban populations of the
Iranian Highlands exhibited a degree of biculturalism. This study explores the evolution of
pottery as a key indicator of social and cultural complexity during this time.
Focusing on recent research at key archaeological sites such as Tepe MeymanatAbad, Tepe
Sofalin, Tepe Qabrestan, Tepe Ozbaki, and Tepe Iyqerbolagh, this paper analyses the pottery
sequence from the Sialk III6-7 phase through to the late Uruk and Proto-Elamite periods. The
evidence suggests that the increasing complexity in pottery production reflects broader socio-
political changes and varying demands for information processing and decision-making within
these emerging complex societies. This study highlights the dynamic interaction between local
and external influences on the Tehran Plain, offering new insights into the evolving cultural
identities of the region during the Late Chalcolithic period.
