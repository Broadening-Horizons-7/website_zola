Domuztepe, most enormous Late Neolithic mounds in the Turkish Eastern Mediterranean, stands out with the painted wares with figurative motifs from the Halaf Period. The Dark-Faced Wares (DFW), which are distinctly differentiated from the pottery groups recovered from the five building levels of Domuztepe due to excavations carried out between 2014-2024, spread over a broad region during the Late Neolithic period. Domuztepe is one of the most important representatives of the Dark-Faced Ware, prominent in the Syro-Cilicia during the Halaf Period. Dark-Faced Wares are still significant groups for this period in Domuztepe. DFW, consisting of bowls and jars, is decorated with impressed, incised, corrugation, and pattern-burnished decorations on their surfaces. While the Dark Faced Wares have unique local characteristics at Domuztepe, the similarities with the Neolithic sites to the west of the settlement prove the intense communication between the regions and settlements during the Neolithic. Located at a critical point between Syro-Cilicia and Mesopotamia, Domuztepe is an substantial Halaf settlement that combines the characteristic of both traditions and reflects different traditions and reflects different traditions together.
