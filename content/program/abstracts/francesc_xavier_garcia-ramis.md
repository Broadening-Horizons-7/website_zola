The Ninevite 5 culture (Early Bronze Age) is formed by a heterogeneous assembly of sites of very varied sizes, distributed in a wide area of the northern Mesopotamian plains. Most of those settlements have not been studied from a global perspective due to modern-day political borders and unmatching scientific efforts. However, some approaches have been developed to assess this feature from a settlement pattern point of view. GIS and some statistical methods were applied to assess the role of the different geographical and political features affecting the distribution of the Ninevite 5 sites. These techniques were applied to a database elaborated through the compilation of the data from bibliographic sources of extensive survey campaigns and fieldwork. As a result, this data can be interpreted in various senses, including an incipient complex organization of the settlements, although some theoretical and methodological reviews are necessary to resolve a possible hierarchical hypothesis.
