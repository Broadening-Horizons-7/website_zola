The replacement of shell fishhooks with copper fishhooks marked a significant advancement for coastal fishing communities in South-Eastern Arabia and the Gulf during the late 4th to early 3rd millennia BCE. This paper aims to analyze the archaeological contexts and typological features of these artifacts in the South Ash-Sharqiyyah region (Oman) to investigate changes in their production, use, and significance to fishing communities, focusing on the sites of Ras Al-Hadd, Ras Al-Jinz, and Wadi Shab, where substantial evidence for fishing activities has been uncovered. By examining these technological changes, the study aims to provide new insights into the craftsmanship and resource management strategies of ancient maritime societies.
