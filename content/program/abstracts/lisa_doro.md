This paper presents a preliminary analysis of the Prehistoric landscape resulting from the survey campaigns carried out in 2023-2024 by the Piedmont Region Archaeological Project (PiRAP) within the Zagros Foothills of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. 
One of the PiRAP project's goals is to study the settlement dynamics of the region by investigating mountainous landscapes, that have been frequently left aside in favour of the well-known Mesopotamian alluvial plains. By employing a specific methodology based on a stratigraphic sampling strategy we attempt to fill a gap in the knowledge of the archaeological evidence known so far in the area. During the fieldwork activity, more than 200 archaeological sites were documented; among these, more than 30 provided a wealth of lithic artefacts, shedding light on the prehistoric occupation of the region. In fact, the rugged landscapes of the Zagros Piedmont, rich in caves, valleys, plateaus, and rock shelters, represent an information source of great potential for understanding the archaeological landscape during these earlier periods. The lithic artefacts also offer insights into the human settling of cultural patterns and circulation of raw material in northern Iraq, contributing significantly to our understanding of the Prehistory of South-West Asia.
