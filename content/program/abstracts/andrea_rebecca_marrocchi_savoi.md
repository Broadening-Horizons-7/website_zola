An important source of information about the intricate social and economic dynamics of the earliest urban cultures is the study of debt contracts in ancient Mesopotamia. These documents, far from being merely econimic tools, were deeply embedded in social relations, shaping networks of power and dependency. This research focuses on the ancient city of Nippur during Ur III (c. 2100-2000 BCE), exploring debt beyond their purely financial function but also as a significant element in the building and maintaining of social capital. By applying social capital theory, which underscores the significance of networks, trust, and reciprocity, we argue that debt contracts functioned as a form of social currency, reinforcing power dynamics and solidifying relationships within the community. Furthermore, this study employs digital humanities methodologies, particularly social network analysis (SNA), to improve the collection and visualization of data extracted from Nippurâ€™s texts. This interdisciplinary approach approach offers a more nuanced understanding of debt's role in molding the economy and social fabric of ancient Nippur by combining conventional historical approaches with digital tools. Ultimately, this research contributes to broader discussions on the significance of social capital in ancient economies and its implications for political and social stability.
