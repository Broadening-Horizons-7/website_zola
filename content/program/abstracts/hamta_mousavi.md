This thesis explores the architecture of Sasanian Zoroastrian fire temples and their connection to the astrological concepts of melothesia and chronocratoria. Melothesia refers to the influence of celestial bodies on different parts of the human body, while chronocratoria deals with the rulership of time periods by specific planets. These concepts are central to understanding the astrological underpinnings of Zoroastrian cosmology, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of the microcosm (humans) and the macrocosm (the universe). The study focuses on chahartaqs, fire temples with a cruciform ground plan and a dome. Using GPS and satellite imagery, I will map and analyze these structures, examining their orientation and geographical features. GIS technology will be employed to create detailed maps and select key sites for in-depth study based on their architectural preservation and natural surroundings. This research aims to reveal how astrological principles influenced the design and placement of fire temples, highlighting the integration of astrology, cosmology, and architecture in Sasanian Zoroastrianism. Through this investigation, the thesis seeks to demonstrate the profound connection between celestial phenomena and human existence as reflected in the architectural heritage of the Sasanian era.
