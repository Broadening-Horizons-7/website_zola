The application of new environmental modelling techniques to the ancient kingdom of Ugarit, modern Ras Shamra, in the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C. allows a quantitative reconstruction of the resources present in the area, leading to the identification of primary subsistence strategies and the deduction of demographic trends. Historical sources from the late 13th century B.C. reveal political instability in the region, resulting in a population shift from rural to urban areas, a trend also supported by archaeological evidence. Additionally, paleoenvironmental data from recent coring in the region indicate a progressive drying of the climate during the same period.
The human response to both anthropogenic and natural events led to a technological development of water-related strategies, as evidenced by archaeological remains such as wells, dams and canals. Integrating recent modelling techniques with information from historical sources allows us to understand the relationship between resource exploitation and population growth. It also opens up new possibilities for interpreting the diachronic development of the ancient Ugaritic landscape.
