The conservation and restoration procedures on cultural heritage nowadays are regulated by a series of international codes, charters and recommendations, as well as by the national laws of each country. These legal codes detail and explain the different actors, criteria and methodologies involved in the different actuations (maintenance, conservation, musealization, excavation etc.) regarding cultural heritage.
The regulation of the national cultural heritage (tangible and intangible) in the United Arab Emirates and the Sultanate of Oman is specified, respectively, in the UAE Law nº11 from 2017, and the Oman Royal Decree 35/2019. In the case of the UAE, some emirates such as Sharjah (Law nº4, 2020) also have their own legal code. Saudi Arabia’s heritage, on the other hand, is regulated in the Law of Antiquity (Royal Decree 26), lastly amended in 2015.
This paper aims to study and compare the legal codes concerning cultural heritage from the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Oman, as well as to introduce the development and different modifications that the three codes, or previous laws regarding cultural heritage, have suffered through time.
