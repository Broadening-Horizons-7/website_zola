The present research investigates the mutual relations between the built environment and social
interactions in the architecture of Neo-Assyrian palaces (911 – 612 BCE). Studies on urban
planning and architecture of the Neo-Assyrian period can be distinguished into two main
approaches: on the one hand, scholars who have mainly focused on identifying the formal and
recurring aspects of Neo-Assyrian space planning; on the other hand, scholars who have
investigated the nonverbal socio-political and symbolic meanings communicated by architecture.
This research aims to reanalyse the spatial patterns of some Neo-Assyrian buildings to shed light on
the hidden social interactions (re)produced by the built environment. Three contexts are
investigated: the North-West Palace of Nimrud (Kalkhu), the A/N Palace of Ziyaret Tepe (Tushhan)
and the Palace G of Zincirli (Sam’al). These palatial contexts are analysed through the _Space Syntax
Analysis_ and the _Integrative Approach_, focusing on elements such as connectivity, accessibility,
visibility and control of specific rooms (i.e., gate, court, throne room, etc.) within each palace. The
results have suggested that the built environment of each palace shapes distinct types of social
relationships, and, as a result, the nonverbal meanings communicated by these spaces are uniquely
influenced by the social interactions that take place within them.
