During the Late Quaternary, Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) played a pivotal role in several major human events, including the dispersal of Homo across Asia and Europe, the origins of agriculture, early urbanization, and the formation of the first state entities. A geoarchaeological approach was used to investigate the relationship between climate change, landscape evolution, and human activity in the KRI. This research adopts a multi-scalar approach, integrating landscape analysis (remote sensing) and site stratigraphy (micro-analysis) to examine human adaptation to climatic, environmental, and resource changes. The focus is on two regions of the KRI, mapping geomorphological features shaped by tectonics and climate. Paleoclimatic data from Zagros Mountain speleothems highlight Early Holocene hydroclimatic fluctuations and their impact on settlement patterns and water resource use, providing the first palaeo-precipitation record for the area. Remote sensing and declassified satellite imagery reconstruct ancient landforms, particularly beneath Mosul Dam Lake, revealing changes in the Tigris River system. Additionally, soil erosion at archaeological sites and shifting land use in ancient Assyrian canals are explored. The pre-urbanization landscape of Erbil demonstrates how ongoing urbanization has transformed river systems and increased vulnerability to environmental risks.
