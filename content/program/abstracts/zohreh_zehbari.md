Located in the Borazjan plain of Bushehr province, north of the Persian Gulf, the modern village
of Dehqaed sits near a cluster of ancient mounds that mark the remains of a long-lost townOur
project focuses on the investigation of the ancient Dehqaed site, which has been largely
underexplored in previous studies. At the site, we have identified 35 distinct mounds, some of
which indicate specialized functions, including industrial and ritual spaces likely linked to the
town’s Zoroastrian community. Ceramic analysis reveals that the site was primarily occupied
from the Achaemenid to the Sasanian periods, though some evidence suggests both earlier and
later habitation. Dehqaed’s strategic location along the main route connecting the highlands to
the lowlands of southern Iran positioned it as a critical link between the mountains and the sea,
facilitating interaction between inland and coastal communities. This paper explores the
Dehqaed site and its surrounding areas, with a focus on the landscape and settlement patterns
of the Borazjan plain. Our investigation highlights the site's significance in southern Iran during
the Achaemenid and Sasanian periods. By examining ceramics from Dehqaed and other nearby
sites, we aim to offer new insights into the region's historical settlement dynamics, trade
networks, and cultural exchanges across different centuries.
