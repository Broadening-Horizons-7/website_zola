This paper presents an ongoing study delving into the socio-economic dynamics and technical specialization observed in lithic industries across the Navkur and Erbil Plains in Iraqi Kurdistan and in the Upper Euphrates region in southeastern Turkey during the early to middle phases of the Late Chalcolithic period, 1 to 3, spanning from the late 5th to early 4th millennium BCE. The research focuses on the technological and functional analysis of lithic artifacts from three key archaeological sites: Asingeran, Arslantepe, and Gird-i Matrab. These sites represent distinct yet interconnected regions of Northern Mesopotamia, an area pivotal to the emergence of complex societies. A specific emphasis shall be on technological typology and archaeometric analyses, including XRF, to determine raw material provenance. The research aims to understand the organization of craft production, patterns of lithic procurement, and the socio-economic transformations leading to complex societies in Northern Mesopotamia. The results are expected to provide new insights into the specialization, standardization, and interregional connections in lithic production, for a better understanding of socio-economic dynamics between the Upper Euphrates and the Kurdistan region.
