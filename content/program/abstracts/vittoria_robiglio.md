In the Malatya Plain, nestled between the mountains of Eastern Anatolia and about ten kilometres from the Euphrates River, lies the site of Arslantepe. The settlement has been the subject of extensive archaeological research and excavations by the MAIAO (Sapienza University of Rome) since 1961, showing continuous occupation from the 5th millennium BCE to the Roman and Byzantine periods.
While the settlement is particularly renowned for its occupation levels from the 4th millennium Late Chalcolithic 3-5 (Periods VII and VIA), recent investigations conducted in the western area of the tell, have revealed an earlier occupation phase known as Period VIII, corresponding to Late Chalcolithic 1-2 . In this area, several superimposed domestic architectural levels have been identified.
A significant contribution to understanding Period VIII at Arslantepe comes from the study of its ceramics, which exhibit a notable variety in fabrics, forms, and decorations. This study presents an initial approach to these topics.
The first step in analysing the ceramics of Period VIII involved classifying diagnostic elements based on fabric type and surface treatment, followed by a typological distinction of shapes and their variations.
Six main fabric classes were identified: Light Chaff, Burnished Chaff, Mixed Chaff (A and B), Mixed Grit, and Grit. As to the shapes, they are primarily divided into bowls and jars, which are further classified based on size, profiles, and rim shapes.
Using this typological framework as a foundation, further analyses investigate specific aspects of Period VIII at Arslantepe, such as the production and standardization of shapes. In particular, the latter is conducted through the analysis of diameters and fabrics, with special attention to the mass-produced bowls, known as "coba bowls."
