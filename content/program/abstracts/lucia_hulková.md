The end of the Second Intermediate Period as presented by the Kamose stelae (as well as later written historical sources) is one of the few notorious narratives relating the history of Ancient Egypt. The ultimately victorious ‘war of libeartion’ waged by the Theban rulers against the foreigners occupying the north of Egypt ended in successful expulsion of the foreigners and re-establishment of rightful Egyptian rule at the beginning of the New Kingdom.
Although this depiction of the end of the Second Intermediate Period and beginning of the New Kingdom is certainly intriguing, the archaeological evidence from the Nile Delta paints a slightly more nuanced picture of the transition between these periods. In my presentation, I will look at the development of burial customs of inhabitants of the Wadi Tumilat from the second half of the Second Intermediate Period to the beginning of the New Kingdom, in order to trace the transition and challenge the narrative suggested by the written sources.
