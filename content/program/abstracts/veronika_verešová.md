Compared to gold, silver was rather rare in Ancient Egypt during the 2nd millennium, mainly due to the scarcity of its sources in the Nile Valley. Nevertheless, silver objects appear in greater quantities in several contexts, which are predominantly funerary in nature. These items, often of personal, funerary, or ritual significance, can serve as indicators of the cultural and social identity of their owners. This study focuses on analyzing selected assemblages and their role in 2nd millennium BCE Egyptian society. We will examine the distribution and composition of these assemblages, focusing not only on individual artifacts but on the broader context in which they were found.
Drawing on assemblage theory, which can be applied in the study of Ancient Egyptian material culture, these assemblages consist of larger or smaller entities that are interconnected. How are they related, and what can they reveal about their owners and their identities? The reconstruction of these assemblages, along with the study of individual objects—including silver artifacts and other related items—highlights their interconnections. It is these connections that offer valuable insights into important socio-historical phenomena of the period.
