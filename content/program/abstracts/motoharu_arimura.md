In the second millennium BCE, pottery suitable for long-distance transport of contents, such as oil, food, and raw materials, began to be produced and distributed across regions in the Eastern Mediterranean. One such group of pottery is known as "Black Lustrous Wheel-made Ware." This pottery was distributed to Cyprus, the Levant, and the Nile Valley, serving as crucial evidence for understanding the trade networks of that time.
The production sites of Black Lustrous Wheel-made Ware have been a subject of much debate for many years. While it is generally recognized as Cypriot pottery today, it is also known that it was produced to some extent in the Levant. Additionally, recent excavations in Egypt have revealed that some of the materials from the Nile Valley were locally produced, making it increasingly difficult to classify all of them simply as Cypriot pottery. The Egyptian materials are key to reassessing the distribution of Black Lustrous Wheel-made Ware, but they have not been sufficiently studied until now.
This presentation aims to reassess the production and distribution of Black Lustrous Wheel-made Ware by examining the finds from the Nile Valley.
