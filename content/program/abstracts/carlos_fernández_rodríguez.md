Interregional trade in the Gulf during the first millennium has been yet demonstrated. It was, in fact, a steady flow of multidirectional exchanges. Our paper aims to analyse the impact of the trade in the Gulf viewed from the Oman Peninsula. It is not, indeed, what materials they exchanged or how did it develop the trade.
However, what were the local consequences of these exchanges with foreign regions? How did the economy of the Oman Peninsula develop because of the Gulf trade? Did it impact homogenously in all the Oman Peninsula? How were the different Omani regions involved in the trade?
At the same time, in our opinion it is necessary to bear in mind the trade with the other part of the Arabian Peninsula across the desert. Was the Iron Age the origin of the later known as caravan trails of the Pre-Islamic Period, when ancient cities as Mleiha became trading hubs for caravans on route from North and South Arabia?
In summary, it seems clear that the Oman Peninsula played a very important role in the Gulf trade, also as an intermediary part, during the Iron Age too.
