This talk explores the complex relationship between economy and diplomacy in the ancient Near East, focusing on the transfer of objects as a key component of diplomatic exchange. Drawing on a wide range of written sources, the talk will analyze how gifts and tribute were used as instruments of political negotiation, alliance building, and the assertion of power. The talk will trace the evolution of diplomatic tools and protocols across regions and periods, examining how they evolved in response to changing political landscapes and cultural interactions. Particular attention will be paid to the symbolic and economic value of the objects exchanged—from precious metals and luxury goods to weapons and livestock—and how their transfer served to reinforce political hierarchies and establish networks of influence. By assessing the changing role of these exchanges over time, the talk aims to deepen our understanding of the mechanisms that underpinned international relations in the ancient Near East and the ways in which material culture was used to maintain diplomatic ties and assert dominance.
