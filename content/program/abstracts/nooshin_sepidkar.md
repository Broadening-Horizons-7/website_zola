This article provides a detailed translation of stanzas 1-9 of Yasna 3, along with a comparative analysis of the Pahlavi commentaries found in two of the oldest Yasna manuscripts, 400_Pt4 from the Iranian tradition and 500_J2 from the Indian tradition. By focusing on these critical texts, the study reveals the specific areas of emphasis in each commentary, including Zoroastrian rituals, theological principles, and interpretations of divine entities. It explores how the Pahlavi commentaries differ in their approach to ritualistic offerings, praises, and theological exegesis, highlighting the textual variations and the impact of these differences on the understanding of Zoroastrian liturgical practices. Through this comparative analysis, the article contributes to a deeper understanding of how Zoroastrian rituals were preserved and interpreted over time in different regions. It also shows how the Pahlavi commentaries bridge the gap between oral traditions and written preservation, ensuring the continuity of religious practices. Ultimately, this research enriches the study of Zoroastrian religious texts by offering updated insights into these ancient traditions and their ritual significance.
