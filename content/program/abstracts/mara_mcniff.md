Scholars of Mediterranean history have long emphasized the role of islands as central hubs in early human mobility. Sicily, the largest Mediterranean island, has frequently been discussed in relation to exchange networks. One area where Sicily has been largely overlooked is in the Iron Age trade of "prestige goods" from the Levant to the Atlantic coast of Iberia, a practice crucial for reconstructing the early expansion of Levantine (Phoenician) merchants. Archaeological evidence suggests that Sicily did not play a significant role in the large-scale acquisition of prestige goods, likely due to its lack of raw materials. A gold phiale from the indigenous site of Santâ€™Angelo Muxaro, however, may indicate an early indigenous effort to participate in these networks. By tracing the biography of this artifact and comparing it to similar objects, I place Sicily within the broader context of conspicuous consumption, reevaluating Sicily's role as a nexus during early Levantine and Greek expansion. Further, this paper highlights the utility of object-based biographies in the reconstruction trade networks and intercultural interaction in the Iron Age Mediterranean.
