A wide distribution of incense burners suggests they held an important place in
antiquityâ€™s ritual and private life. Researchers mainly focus on incense burners from
the Levant and Mediterranean regions, where numerous specimens can be categorised
within this object group. Few original examples seem to originate from Mesopotamia,
making Mesopotamian Thymiateria a relatively unexplored group. However, the lack
of physical specimens contrasts sharply with the abundance of cylinder seals and
reliefs showing objects used for fumigation and incense burning. The absence of coal
and incense residue further complicates identifying these objects as incense burners,
making visual representations of their use more significant. The numerous depictions
suggest these objects played an important role in Mesopotamian society.
My dissertation aims to contribute to this research by using a detailed analysis of
visual representations to categorise potential physical specimens. The focus is on
Mesopotamian incense burners of the bowl-on-stand type and what can be concluded
about the societal structures they were embedded in. Furthermore, I seek to clarify
whether the function and use depicted in numerous iconographic and written sources
can be confirmed when considering physical specimens. This project will further the
debate on this group of archaeological finds, particularly in terms of terminology. It
will also provide a comprehensive overview of Mesopotamian
