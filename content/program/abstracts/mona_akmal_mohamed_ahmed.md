The identification, preservation, and showcasing of prehistoric heritage assets, whether natural or cultural, face numerous challenges. These challenges stem from the unique nature of evidence from this period, which is characterized by its low visibility, distinct material culture, absence of textual resources, and limited or schematic iconographic evidence. Additionally, there is often poor preservation and documentation of sites and collections. Recently, more challenges have emerged, primarily driven by humanity's entry into the Anthropocene. The accelerating impact of climate change is now recognized as a major factor threatening the existence and sustainability of our cultural and natural heritage assets. Prehistoric sites and collections are particularly vulnerable to these negative impacts due to their unique characteristics. This research aims to examine the extent to which prehistoric assets might be affected by climate change and evaluate how these sites and collections might also serve as means to mitigate those impacts.
