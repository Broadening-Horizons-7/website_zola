The study and understanding of Egyptian social and political mechanisms have significantly evolved in recent decades, providing clearer insights into Egypt's power structures. However, many questions remain unresolved, particularly regarding the interpretative models scholars should apply to make sense of a diverse range of evidence. This evidence spans from literary hymns portraying an uncontested monarch to local administrative documents and archaeological data. A key area of debate is the extent of control exerted by the administrative center over the country and its inhabitants.
In response to this, I aim to engage in a discussion of the terms in which this debate has recently been framed. I will compare major Egyptological perspectives, such as those of J.C. Moreno Garcia and H. Willems, with more theoretical approaches that can help us rethink the interactions between the state, the population, and intermediaries. Specifically, I plan to explore Gramsci's concept of ‘hegemony,’ which is particularly useful for understanding the relationship between economic dominance and the control of knowledge production, as well as how the agency of various groups is shaped by an unequal distribution of power. Additionally, I intend to draw on the school of anarchist anthropology, particularly the works of James C. Scott, to examine the complexity of Egyptian society’s submission to authority.
