Since Glueckâ€™s first systematic survey in 1934, many excavation and survey projects have focused on the Early Bronze Age of Jordan, but some areas are better known than other for the fourth and third millennia BCE.
Current maps of the Early Bronze Age in the Madaba region are focused on a few major excavated sites with long stratigraphic sequences. However, open-source databases and fieldwork reports may provide broader datasets that reveal a more extensive Early Bronze Age settlement in this area. By integrating archaeological data with environmental information and reconstructions of the ancient landscape, we can better understand the occupational dynamics and economic activities in the region between the 4th and the end of the 3rd millennia BCE, as well as how these evolved over time.
The aim of this paper is to reanalyse these regional datasets using a landscape-based approach, incorporating GIS technology to produce a more comprehensive picture of Early Bronze Age inhabitation in the Madaba region.
