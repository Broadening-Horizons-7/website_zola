The world’s earliest documented transition from village to urban life took place in Mesopotamia during the fourth millennium BC. In order to reconstruct the steps leading to this process, archaeologists have long focussed on the development of village life in the preceding ‘Ubaid period, corresponding broadly to the 5th millennium BC. This research aims to contribute to this process by presenting new evidence pertaining to changes in agricultural methods and the organization of food surplus from Late ‘Ubaid period called Gurga Chiya,  a site located in the Sharizor Plain of Iraqi Kurdistan. Excavation of the mid to late 5th millennium BC sequence at Gurga Chiya led to the discovery of an architectural complex with partially preserved pisé building. One of the preserved rooms appears to have been used as a storage area for plant-based foods, as indicated by dense deposits of archaeobotanical remains, especially lentils and cereals. In this paper, we combine archaeological, architectural and archaeobotanical analysis to investigate the relationship between food storage and domestic economy at Gurga Chiya. These methods are supplemented by stable isotope analysis of Δ13C and δ15N values from preserved grains at Gurga Chiya and from the adjacent, Late Neolithic site Tepe Marani. This, in turn, provides a diachronic perspective on changes in the methods used for cultivating crops, during the crucial period of the 5th millennium BC.
