“War is politics by other means” and “no army can march on an empty stomach” are two adages that are rarely combined in historical studies. In this presentation, I will argue two points: first, that during their Levantine campaigns, the Egyptians of the 18th Dynasty established a logistical network  – a series of fortresses capable of supporting military actions – in the war theatre; second, that by reconstructing both this network and the campaigns it facilitated, it is possible to gain key insights into the foreign policy objectives that underpinned these military endeavours.
