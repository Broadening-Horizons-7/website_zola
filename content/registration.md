## Papers and posters guidelines

**Note that the call for papers is now closed!**

All speakers are requested to observe a 20-minute limit for presenting papers. Presentations will be given in English with Powerpoint presentations. Please note that the usage of a different software will not be possible due to the hybrid format of the conference.

Posters are also welcome and have to be prepared in A1 or A0 format; they will be displayed throughout the conference, and a time slot will be dedicated for a posters session.


## Proceedings

After the conference, presenters will be invited to submit their papers for review and publication in the Conference Proceedings.

## Visa Invitation Letters

Broadening Horizons 7 participants may request official visa invitation letters if needed to help facilitate their travel to Italy. In order to be eligible for a personalized visa letter, you must first register for the conference AND pay your registration fees in full. To request a PDF visa invitation letter, please email [bh7.sapienza@uniroma1.it](mailto:bh7.sapienza@uniroma1.it) with a copy of your paid registration.

 

## Participation Certificates
All registered conference participants will receive a participation certificate on-site when they check in at the registration desk. We understand that such documentation may be used by your institution as evidence of your participation in order to justify reimbursement of expenses. Our participation certificates verify your registration and attendance at BH7, hence you must pick them up in person. Participation certificates do not contain any specific information about presentations as part of the conference program.
