## Changes, Challenges, and New Frontiers

There is a call for the Ancient World Studies to go global and engage in multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research. By increasing its outreach,  this field  can break through the boundaries of the academic community and play an active role in contemporary society. Through five thematic sessions, BH 7 aims at bringing together people working with different theoretical and methodological approaches to discuss how the connection between traditional and innovative strategies may open new frontiers and pose new challenges to investigate, understand, and explain past societies. The conference welcomes papers on archaeology, Egyptology, history, ancient languages, ancient religions, history of art, the application of scientific methods, social sciences, data science, and computer science to the investigation and reconstruction of the past, and finally on the protection, promotion, and communication of Cultural Heritage.
