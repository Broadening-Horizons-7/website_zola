The call for papers for the Broadening Horizons 7 is now closed! We have received more than 100 submissions and we thank all the colleagues that sent an abstract. The organizing committee will read and evaluate the abstracts and will provide an answer with the confirmation of acceptance to the conference by the 15th of October. 

If you did not receive an abstract submission confirmation email, please reach out to us at [bh7.sapienza@uniroma1.it](mailto:bh7.sapienza@uniroma1.it).

Stay tuned, payment procedures will also open after the abstracts evaluation.
