We are happy to announce that the preliminary program for the BH7 is now published! Head to the [program page](/program/schedule) to see the list of speakers and the schedule of the conference. A [Book of Abstracts](/program/abstracts) is also available. These two pages are interconnected, so you can see the abstract of each talk by clicking on the title in the schedule, and view the position of each speaker in the program by clicking the respective link in their abstract page.

Make also sure to read the [General Information](/program/general-info) page for the logistics of the conference (registration desk, wifi, etc.) and information for speakers and poster presenters.

For details about our events during the conference, check the [Events](/program/events) page. 

We are looking forward to seeing you at the conference!
