Broadening Horizons (BH) is a series of international conferences organized by and dedicated to graduate, postgraduate students, and early-career researchers. This conference series deals with the broad field of the human past in Western Asia and Egypt in pre-Classical and Classical times.

The seventh edition - Broadening Horizons 7 (BH7) - pivots around the general theme “Changes, Challenges and New Frontiers”, and it will take place in a hybrid format (both in-person and online). The 5-day conference will take place from 10 to 14 February 2025, and it will be hosted at Sapienza University of Rome. Given its international spirit, English will be the official language of the conference. 

The conference is structured in [five thematic sessions](/about/sessions), which promote the scientific exchange between scholars from different fields, including archaeological, anthropological, historical, philological, and cultural heritage studies, as well as related interdisciplinary fields. We particularly welcome students and scholars in the early stage of their careers to present their research or to attend papers presented by both their peers and more experienced colleagues. 

The conference is jointly hosted by the departments: [Istituto Italiano di Studi Orientali](https://web.uniroma1.it/diso/en), [Dipartimento di Scienze dell'Antichità](https://www.antichita.uniroma1.it/eng), [Dipartimento di Storia Antropologia Religioni Arte Spettacolo](https://saras.uniroma1.it/en), and organized with the support of [Scuola di Dottorato in Archeologia](https://phd.uniroma1.it/web/PHD-SCHOOL-OF-ARCHAEOLOGY_nD3482_EN.aspx), [Scuola di Specializzazione in Beni Archeologici](https://web.uniroma1.it/scuola_beniarcheologici/en), [Fondazione Sapienza](https://www.fondazionesapienza.uniroma1.it/), [Amici di Ebla](https://www.amicidiebla.org/), [Centro Internazionale
