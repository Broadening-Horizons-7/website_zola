Broadening Horizons (BH) is a series of international conferences organized by and dedicated to graduate, postgraduate students, and early-career researchers. This conference series deals with the broad field of the human past in Western Asia in pre-Classical times.

The seventh edition - Broadening Horizons 7 (BH7) - pivots around the general theme “Changes, Challenges and New Frontiers”, and it will take place in a hybrid format (both in-person and online).

The conference is structured in [five thematic sessions](/program/sessions), which promote the scientific exchange between scholars from different fields, including archaeological, anthropological, historical, philological, and cultural heritage studies, as well as related interdisciplinary fields. We particularly welcome students and scholars in the early stage of their careers to present their research or to attend papers presented by both their peers and more experienced colleagues.
