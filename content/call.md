Deadline for submitting abstracts for papers and posters is **September 15th, 2024**. 

**Papers proposal**

Those who wish to participate in the conference and present a paper should submit an abstract in English of about 200 words (or 1500 characters). Abstracts should be submitted via the registration form either using the [following link](https://forms.gle/vEf5MszSzWbKczyeA) or through the embedded form below.
