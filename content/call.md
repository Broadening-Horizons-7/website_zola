The Call for Papers is now open!  

Deadline for submitting abstracts for papers and posters is **September 15th, 2024**. 

**Papers proposal**

Those who wish to participate in the conference and present a paper should submit an abstract in English of about 200 words (or 1500 characters). Abstracts should be submitted via the [registration form](https://forms.gle/vEf5MszSzWbKczyeA).

The Organizing Committee will assess the abstracts received with regard to their quality and pertinence to the conference theme and relative sessions; accepted papers will be notified shortly afterwards (maximum within a month after the submission deadline).

All speakers are requested to observe a 20-minute limit for presenting papers. Presentations will be given in English with Powerpoint presentations. Please note that the usage of a different software will not be possible due to the hybrid format of the conference.

**Posters**

Posters are also welcome and have to be prepared in A1 or A0 format; they will be displayed throughout the conference, and a time slot will be dedicated for a posters session.

Please note that poster proposals should also be submitted via the [registration form](https://forms.gle/vEf5MszSzWbKczyeA).

Please see the attached PDF file for more details about participation fees, sessions and such.



**Proceedings**

After the conference, presenters will be invited to submit their papers for review and publication in the Conference Proceedings.
