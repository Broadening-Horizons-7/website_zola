The proceedings of the conference will be published as dedicated volumes of CMAO (Contributi e Materiali di Archeologia Orientale). This scientific journal associated with the Department of Sciences of Antiquity (and published by Scienze & Lettere, via Piave 7 - Rome) has been for nearly 40 years the traditional journal of Sapienza for publications on the ancient Near East. Proceedings will give visibility to the work of young researchers, as well as to the members of the Organizing Committee as editors of the volumes. The publication is foreseen within a time frame of 2 years after the conference (to be ideally presented during the following edition of the BH conference, BH8).
